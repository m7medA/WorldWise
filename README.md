# WorldWise

WorldWise is a travel tracking application built with React. It allows you to mark cities you have visited on an interactive map, add personal notes and visit dates, and view details about each city. You can also remove cities from your list and explore more information about each location via Wikipedia links.

The project demonstrates modern React development, including global state management with Context API, modular CSS for styling, advanced hooks for performance and side effects, and seamless navigation with React Router. WorldWise is designed to help you create a digital travel journal and visualize your journeys in a user-friendly and responsive interface.
